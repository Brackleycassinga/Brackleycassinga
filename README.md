Email: pcassinga@email.com

Location: Democratic Republic of Congo currently residing in Kigali/Rwanda

I am a software engineer with over 5 years of experience building user interfaces and web services. I am proficient in Typescript, JavaScript, React, and other front-end frameworks. I have worked for several companies, including XYZ Corporation and ABC Corporation, where I developed and maintained software applications. I am currently working for Ukama as a software engineer, building web services in Go Lang.

My projects on GitHub include:

Project 1: A web application built with React and Redux, which allows users to search for and save their favorite movies.
Project 2: A command-line tool written in Go Lang, which allows users to generate random passwords with customizable options.
Project 3: A library written in Typescript, which provides utility functions for working with dates and times.
I am always looking for new opportunities to learn and grow as a developer. If you have any questions or would like to collaborate, please feel free to contact me.
