I am a software engineer with over 5 years of experience building user interfaces and web services. I am passionate about connecting rural communities to the internet, and have worked for Ope Cellular deploying the first GSM community network in eastern DRC. I am currently residing in Kigali, Rwanda. I am proficient in Typescript, JavaScript, React, and other front-end frameworks. I have worked for several companies, including XYZ Corporation and ABC Corporation, where I developed and maintained software applications. I am currently working for Ukama as a software engineer, building web services in Go Lang.


My web Project:

https://www.altech-rdc.com/: A web application built with React and Redux, which allows users to visit Altech services.

I am always looking for new opportunities to learn and grow as a developer. If you have any questions or would like to collaborate, please feel free to contact me.
